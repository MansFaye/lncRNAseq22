### Main Steps:
1. Quality Control of raw reads
2. Mapping
3. Transcriptome assembly
4. Quantification
5. Differential Expression
6. Integrative analysis & Prioritization

## Packages
FastQC (ver. 0.11.9):
MultiQC (ver. 1.8):

## Data
### Experimental data:
RNA-seq data from TruSeq Stranded mRNA libraries, 3 replicates per clone.

### Reference data:


# Quality Control of raw reads
We check for quality of the sequencing data using the FastQC package, and visualize results for all replicates using MultiQC.
See README in `./analysis/rawqc` for detailed information.
